<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution with TDD-first approach.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

**Critical workflow for each plan:**
1. **Decompose:** If a plan is large, ask the user to split it into smaller sub-tasks (each < 30 min estimate)
2. **TDD-first:** For each subtask, write tests that define the expected behavior BEFORE implementing
3. **Implement:** Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verify:** Run tests to confirm the subtask is complete
5. **Commit:** Only mark subtask done when tests pass
6. **Move on:** Track completed work and move to next subtask

Each plan should complete in one or two agent iterations. If a plan keeps failing after 2+ attempts, escalate for user guidance.

Optional wave filter:
- `--wave N` executes only Wave `N` for pacing, quota management, or staged rollout
- phase verification/completion still only happens when no incomplete plans remain after the selected wave finishes

Flag handling rule:
- The optional flags documented below are available behaviors, not implied active behaviors
- A flag is active only when its literal token appears in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If a documented flag is absent from `$ARGUMENTS`, treat it as inactive

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API.

Phase: $ARGUMENTS

**Available optional flags (documentation only — not automatically active):**
- `--wave N` — Execute only Wave `N` in the phase. Use when you want to pace execution or stay inside usage limits.
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.
- `--interactive` — Execute plans sequentially inline (no subagents) with user checkpoints between tasks. Lower token usage, pair-programming style. Best for small phases, bug fixes, and verification gaps.

**Active flags must be derived from `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- `--wave N` is active only if the literal `--wave` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--gaps-only` is active only if the literal `--gaps-only` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--interactive` is active only if the literal `--interactive` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If none of these tokens appear, run the standard full-phase execution flow with no flag-specific filtering
- Do not infer that a flag is active just because it is documented in this prompt

Context files are resolved inside the workflow via `phase-sdk query init.execute-phase` and per-subagent `<files_to_read>` blocks.
