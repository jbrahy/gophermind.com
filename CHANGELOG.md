## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-09
### Added
- First-run setup wizard — endpoint, API key, model picker, approval mode, and max iterations — saved to a global config, plus a `gophermind config` command to re-run it.
- Signed + notarized macOS release pipeline (GoReleaser) distributed via a Homebrew cask, and a `gophermind version` command.
- A random fortune, the version, and recent changes shown under the gopher banner on startup.
- A redrawn gopher ASCII banner.

### Changed
- No endpoint is baked into the binary anymore — configure it via the wizard, a provider profile, or `GOPHERMIND_BASE_URL`.

### Fixed
- The terminal OSC-11 background-color query no longer leaks escape codes into the input box.
