# Build, sign, notarize and staple the GopherMind Desktop macOS app.
#
# Usage: scripts/build-desktop.sh <version> [--skip-build]
# Env:   MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY   Developer ID Application identity or its SHA-1
#                             hash. Unset means "skip signing" (dev builds).
#        MACOS_NOTARY_PROFILE  notarytool keychain profile. Unset means
#                             "skip notarization".
#
# GoReleaser cannot build this artifact: it produces Go binaries, and a Wails
# app is a .app bundle with an Info.plist, an icon and a frontend baked in. So
# the desktop app is built here and attached to the same GitHub release through
# GoReleaser's release.extra_files.
#
# The ORDER below is the part worth getting right, and it differs from the CLI's:
#
#   1. build      wails, universal (amd64 + arm64)
#   2. sign       Developer ID, hardened runtime, secure timestamp
#   3. zip        ditto --keepParent, because notarytool takes a zip/dmg/pkg
#                 and never a bare .app
#   4. notarize   submit --wait
#   5. STAPLE     onto the .app, then re-zip
#
# Step 5 is why this is not just a copy of notarize-binary.sh. A bare CLI binary
# cannot carry a stapled ticket, so the CLI relies on Gatekeeper's online check.
# A bundle CAN, and a stapled app launches cleanly on a machine that is offline
# or behind a firewall that blocks Apple's notary service. Skipping the staple
# produces an app that works on the machine that built it and shows "cannot be
# opened" on a locked-down one, which is the worst way to find out.
