## Providers that need no API key

These serve requests anonymously, which makes them the zero-signup way to try
gophermind. Each was verified against a live endpoint when this shipped;
re-verify with `gophermind free check <profile>`.

`gophermind free list` shows these too, so `gophermind free show <profile>`
always resolves, but `gophermind --profile <profile>` refuses to start until
the noted blocker is addressed.

Some free tiers carry obligations beyond a rate limit. `gophermind free show
